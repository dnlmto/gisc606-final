1. What was your favorite part of the class? I really liked the advnaced remote sensing aspect with more python involved workflows.

2. What was your least favorite part of the class?
   I felt that the pace of the courses were fine except for having more of a background on the material and having more reading material in general.

4. Do you have any suggestions for how the instructor could improve the class experience for future students?
   I think Alex was great and very responsive to students' needs, I think the typing was a bit fast but the pace was fine,
   a little louder on the mic as sometimes the audio seemed a bit faint.
