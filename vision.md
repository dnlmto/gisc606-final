***Note I ran out of codespace for the 'billing period' so I will just leave the final responses here.***

1. What is your "dream" GIS/tech job? I think my dream gis/tech job would be to have my own gis based company,
   or work at ESRI as a solutions engineer. Or gain enough skills to become a GIS developer.
   
2. What GIS applications or technologies excite you most? The use of ArcGIS SDK with websites or automation development.
   
3. What GIS skills/techniques or non-GIS hobbies would you like to focus on after this semester ends?
   I will definitely focus on my health and start going to the gym again, as well as make time to practice more coding for my applied project.
